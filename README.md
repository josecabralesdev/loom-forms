## ‚ú® Features

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Form Generation
Describe your need in 1-2 sentences (e.g., "Collect customer feedback for a restaurant"). Our AI, powered by Gemini, instantly generates a draft form structure with appropriate fields (name, rating, comments, etc.), so you don't have to start from a blank slate.

### üñ±Ô∏è Drag-and-Drop Customization
The AI draft is just the beginning. Intuitively rearrange fields, add new questions, remove unnecessary ones, or adjust labels and placeholders with a simple, powerful drag-and-drop interface.

### ‚úÖ Smart Validation Rules
Focus on the questions, not the rules. Loom Forms automatically suggests intelligent validation rules (like email format, required fields, number ranges, etc.) based on the field type and the form's overall purpose.

### üì§ Export & seamless Integration
Your form is ready. Now deploy it anywhere.
- **Export as HTML/JSON:** Get clean, standard code to use in your own projects.
- **Embed via iFrame:** Copy a single snippet of code to embed your form directly into any website or CMS like WordPress, Webflow, or Squarespace.
